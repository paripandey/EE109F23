                          Lab 2 - Scopes and Signals

Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kHz", or "200 msec"

Note: Don't use special characters like Greek "mu" or "Omega" symbols in your
answers.  These don't display correctly on Vocareum and can make it hard to
grade the answers.  For example, if you need to specify units of microseconds,
just type "microseconds" or "usecs".


1. (5 points) Fill out the following table for outputs A0 and A1. The duty
cycle of a signal is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the time the
signal is in the high state to the period of the signal.

    Bit     Time in 1 state     Time in 0 state     Period                  Frequency       Duty cycle

    A0      1200 microseconds   380 microseconds    1580 microseconds       632.91 Hz       75.9%

    A1      600 microseconds    2600 microseconds   3200 microseconds       312.5 Hz        18.75%


CHECKPOINT: Show a CP your measurements of the two periodic signals to
received the bonus points.

of the NOT gate?
    4.6 nanoseconds

                          ---- Review Questions ----

1. (3 points) Suppose you wanted to measure the frequency of a note played by
a piano and sensed from a microphone connected/viewed on an oscilloscope.
Answer the following True/False questions with a brief explanation.

     a. True/False: To measure the frequency, the vertical scale of the
     oscilloscope would be of more use than the horizontal scale.

        FALSE. The horizontal scale represents the time scale of the oscilloscope.
        As this helps us measure the timing/period of the respective signals,
        it will consequently help us measure the frequency.

     b. True/False: Since the note is played for a short time period, we
     should set the triggering to "Single" rather than "Run".
     
        TRUE. This signal (aka. a pulse) is not periodic, being in the low
        state most of the time but occasionally going high for a short time.
        It appears at random times, and the pulse width and the time it is
        in the high state, varies slightly each time. We want to capture a
        single instance of the note being played.

     c. True/False: If the signal ranges between 0V and 2.5V, the trigger
     level should ideally be set around 1.25V.

        FALSE. While this would make sure the oscilloscope triggers on the falling/rising
        edge of the signal, the "ideal" trigger level may depend on the signal's
        specific characteristics to help capture the desired part of the waveform.

2. (2 points) Each scope probe has a short black ground wire attached to it.
Why is it necessary to connect this to the circuit's ground point in order to
make a measurement?

    Because it will establish a common (ground) reference point for the
    measurement. It ensures that the measurements are referenced to the same electrical
    potential as the circuit being measured. Otherwise, the
    oscilloscope wouldn't have a proper reference, and the measurements would
    be inaccurate and potentially misleading.


3. (1 point) If you have used the Horizontal Position control to move the
trigger point horizontally so much that you can no longer see the trigger point
on the screen, what is the quick way to restore the trigger point back to the
middle of the screen?

    Pressing the horizontal position knob.
