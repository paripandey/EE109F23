1. (1 point) Tammy Trojan feels the gap between the MID brightness using a
37.5% PWM signal and the BRIGHT level at 100% is too much and wants to add a
fourth brightness level at 75% called "LIT".  In our circuit where a low signal
turns the LED on, this means she needs to create a signal that is low 75% of
the time, or a one 25% of the time. Assuming you had access to additional gates
to add to the circuit, how could you create this signal?  Write the Boolean
logic express for LIT in terms of the output signals from the counter.

	ANSWER:
		This means either 0000 to 0011 are minterms, or 1100 to 1111 are minterms.
		This yields POS expressions (!QD • !QC) and (QD • QC), respectively.
		Assuming we want a NAND-to-NAND implementation, we can take POS (QD • QC) and
		OR it with an AND gate that takes ground (O) as at least 1 of the inputs. If
		we invert the inputs of the OR gate, then we get (QD NAND QC) AND (0 NAND 0).
		We can make this (QD NAND QC) NAND (0 NAND 0) and then just invert the output
		with another NAND gate. This is a total of 4 NAND gates with another 74HCT00.

2. (1 point) We would like to add a feature where if the Select button is
pressed on the LCD, it turns the LED off completely, and then turns it back on
when Select is pressed again.  Explain how this could be done without having to
make any changes to the wiring of the circuit.
