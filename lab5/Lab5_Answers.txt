Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) To ensure a date appears in the format: MM/DD, what snprintf()
formatting string could be used to ensure dates like 6/9 are generated in a
character buffer as 06/09.

	char buf[17];
	int m = 6; d = 9;
	snprintf(buf, 17, "%02d/%02d", m, d);


1. (3 points) Review the conceptual operation of an ADC and use the given
parameters to find the desired value.

  a. Your 8-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 1V and 4V, what digital
  number would result from sampling a 2.0V?

  ANSWER:

    Method is to set up a linear equation. 
    y represents the input voltage.
    x represents the digital number.
    f(x) represents the relatonship between the digital number and the input voltage.
    The smallest 8-bit number, 0000 0000, corresponds to the Lo reference voltage: (0, 1)
    The highest 8-bit number, 1111 1111 (decimal: 255), corresponds to the Hi reference voltage: (255, 4)

    y = f(x) = (4-1)(x)/(2^8-1) + 1 = 3x/255 + 1

    Basically, what is x when y = 2?
    
    (2 - 1) * 255/3 = x = 85
  
  Therefore, the digital number is 85.

  
  b. Your 5-bit ADC has Hi and Lo reference voltages of 0V and 5V, what input
  voltage would yield a digital number of 12?

  ANSWER:
    Same method and variables as the previous question.
    The smallest 5-bit number, 00000, corresponds to the Lo reference voltage: (0, 0)
    The highest 5-bit number, 11111 (decimal: 31), corresponds to the Hi reference voltage: (31, 5)

    y = f(x) = (5)(x)/(2^5-1) = 5x/31

    What is y when x = 12?
    
    y = f(12) = 60/31 = 1.93

  Therefore, the answer is 1.93V.


  c.  Your 6-bit ADC has a Lo reference voltages of 2V. A voltage is sampled at
  2.4V and the digital result is 26. What was the Hi reference voltage used by
  the ADC?

  ANSWER:
    Same method and variables as the previous question.
    The smallest 6-bit number, 000000, corresponds to the Lo reference voltage: (0, 2)
    The highest 6-bit number, 111111 (decimal: 63), corresponds to the Hi reference voltage: (63, ?)

    y = 2.4, x = 26 ->

    2.4 = (Hi - 2)(26)/(63) + 2
    (2.4 - 2)*63/26 + 2 = Hi = 2.96V

  Therefore, the answer is 2.96V.
