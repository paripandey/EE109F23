		    Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (2 points) TIMER1 is to be used to output a 50% duty cycle signal
(squarewave) for tone generation as was done in this lab.  For the two tones
specified below, determine a prescalar, the OCR1A value, and the number of
interrupts to allow before stopping the timer.  Your answer for the prescalar
and OCR1A values should be the ones that give the most accurate timing.

a. 200 Hz tone for 5 seconds

ANSWER:
	1/(2 * 200) = the delay for each signal of the frequency (half the period) = 0.0025 seconds
	16000000 * 0.0025 = 40,000, the cycle count, which is less than 65,535.

	Therefore, the prescalar is 1, and the OCR1A value is 40,000.
	The number of interrupts is given by 2 * 200 * 5 = 2,000.


b. 32 Hz tone for 2 seconds

ANSWER:
	1/(2 * 32) = the delay for each signal of the frequency (half the period) = 0.015625 seconds
	16000000 * 0.015625 = 250,000, the cycle count, which is greater than 65,535.
	If we use a prescalar of 8, then the cycle count would be 31,250, which is under 65,535.

	Therefore, the prescalar is 8, and the OCR1A value is 31,250.
	The number of interrupts is given by 2 * 32 * 2 = 128.


2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.

ANSWER:
	There are multiple delays in the LCD functions, which would prevent the program from
	detecting any other interrupts/events that would otherwise occur shortly afterwards.
