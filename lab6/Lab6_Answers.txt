Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.

  a. For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and
  prescalar of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?

  ANSWER:
    (16 * 10^6 * x)/64 = 2000
    x = (2000 * 64)/(16 * 10^6)

    Rearranging this equation to solve for x gives us 0.008 seconds or 8 milliseconds.

  b. With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest
  amount of time we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.

  ANSWER: 
    (16 * 10^6) / 8 = 2 * 10^6 = new clock frequency
    1/new clock frequency = time = 0.5 microseconds

    Maximum value that a 8-bit number can have = 255

    255 * 0.5 = 127.5 microseconds
  

2. (2 points) The Timer modules we have used also have the ability to make an
output pin turn ON (set), OFF (clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the
OCR1A or OCR1B values (i.e. the hardware can automatically control the output
value of a pin). By searching the data sheet (ATmega328P datasheet is linked on
our website from the Tools and Links page) answer the following question:

   a.  TIMER1 (the 16-bit timer) can control the pins that are associated with
   OC1A and OC1B signals. Find to what pins these signals are wired by looking
   at Figure 1.1 ("28 PDIP" package diagram) on page 12 of the data sheet, or
   alternatively, Tables 14-3, 14-6, or 14-9.

    ANSWER: PB1 and PB2.


   b.  In this lab we use TIMER1 in the "Clear Timer on Compare" or CTC
   mode. In this mode when the counter reaches the value in OCR1A register it
   generates an interrupt and starts counting again from zero. Using the
   information in section 16.11.1 and table 16-1, describe what the OC1A and
   OC1B pins would do when the timer reaches the OCR1A value if during
   initialization we used the statement TCCR1A = 0x60;

    ANSWER:

    0x60 corresponds to 01100000. This means the COM1A0 and COM1B1 bit are written to 1.
    Based on the combination in the table, OC1A will be toggled on Compare Match. Conversely, OC1B will
    be cleared on Compare Match. Basically, the OC1A and OC1B outputs override the normal port
    functionality of the I/O pins that they're connected to, respectively.
